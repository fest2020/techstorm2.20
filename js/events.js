            lasers and movable Egyptian-themed game pieces that have embedded mirrors that can be
            positioned to bounce the laser light around the board and hit opponent pieces.To play, players
            alternate moving their pieces around the board. Some pieces have mirrors and some do not.
            Bounding the board is a raised frame into which are built two low-power lasers, one for each player.
            The game pieces include a &quot;pharaoh&quot;, obelisks, and pyramids with mirrors. After each move, a player
            must press the button on his/her laser. The beam bounces from mirror to mirror around the playing
            field. The challenge is to protect one&#39;s own pharaoh while maneuvering to &quot;light up&quot; the opposing
            player&#39;s pharaoh.<br/><br/>

            curiosity in a student which in turn forces them to think and
            
            creatively find solutions to the challenges. Students enjoy
